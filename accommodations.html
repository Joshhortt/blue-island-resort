    <h1> Accommodations. </h1>
    <h2> Choose your perfect room. </h2>
    <p> The energies of the four elements – Earth, Fire, Water and Air – <br/>
        Are reflected in the temperament and character of every individual person. <br/>
        A person can be down-to-earth, fiery, cool or breezy, depending on which element predominates in them. <br/>
        Have we aroused your interest in the elements of our rooms? <br/>
        <strong>The entire team at Blue Island Resort are looking forward to providing you with a fantastic holiday!</strong>
